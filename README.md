# MonsterBlockWriter

Writes markdown monster stat blocks for homebrewery based on my own personal Excel monster creator template.
Nobody should be following or forking this. It's terrible.
It's poorly coded, and poorly documented. It is an example of everything you do NOT want to do when you're engineering software.
It's written in Rust, and I don't even consider myself compitent in Rust yet. I barely understand ownership and borrowing, and then only at a high level.
God help you if you read my code, because he ain't helping me.
